## ü§ù **Peer Help Guidelines**

### **Effective Technical Help (Examples)**

#### **Good Help Example:**
**Question**: "My PBKDF2 implementation is running too slowly"
**Helpful Answer**: 
> "I had the same issue! Try reducing iterations for testing (like 10,000 instead of 100,000), but document why. Also, check if you're re-creating the KDF object in loops - create it once. Here's the performance difference I saw: [specific numbers]. For production, consider using hardware acceleration or async processing."

#### **Great Resource Sharing:**
**Post**: "Found an excellent NIST guide on key management"
**Response**: 
> "Thanks! That NIST doc helped me understand key rotation. I also found this complementary resource on key escrow: [link]. The combination really clarified the enterprise key lifecycle."

### **Academic Integrity Guidelines**

#### **‚úÖ Encouraged Sharing:**
- **Debugging approaches** and troubleshooting strategies
- **Resource recommendations** with explanation of value
- **Concept explanations** in your own words
- **Alternative implementation approaches**
- **Common error solutions**

#### **‚ùå Not Allowed:**
- **Complete assignment solutions** or direct code copying
- **Quiz answers** or specific question solutions
- **Verbatim tutorial implementations** without understanding
- **Assignment submissions** for other students

#### **‚öñÔ∏è Gray Area - Ask First:**
- **Code snippets** that demonstrate concepts (small, educational portions OK)
- **Configuration examples** that show implementation patterns
- **Pseudocode** that explains algorithms without giving complete solutions
