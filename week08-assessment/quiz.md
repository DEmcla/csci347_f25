## Answer Key (Instructor Use Only)

### Part A: True/False
1. **F** - Penetration testing requires proper authorization and consent
2. **T** - Vulnerability assessments identify but don't exploit weaknesses
3. **T** - Social engineering can be part of comprehensive pen tests
4. **F** - OWASP Top 10 focuses on web application security
5. **T** - Red team exercises are more comprehensive, simulating real adversaries

### Part B: Multiple Choice
6. **B** - Penetration testing attempts to exploit found vulnerabilities
7. **C** - Reconnaissance (information gathering)
8. **B** - Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
9. **D** - All NIST frameworks contribute to cybersecurity risk management
10. **B** - 0-10 (0 = no impact, 10 = critical)
11. **B** - Black box provides most realistic external attacker simulation
12. **A** - To identify potential attack vectors
13. **B** - Nessus (vulnerability scanner)
14. **B** - Document it and inform stakeholders
15. **B** - PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard)

### Part C: Short Answer (Sample Answers)
16. Defense in depth is a layered security strategy using multiple security controls and measures to protect assets, so if one layer fails, others continue to provide protection.

17. Authenticated scans use valid credentials to examine systems from an insider perspective, while unauthenticated scans test from an external attacker's viewpoint without credentials.

18. Scope definition prevents legal issues, ensures testing stays within authorized boundaries, and helps allocate appropriate time and resources for the assessment.

19. Executive summary with business risk context and detailed technical findings with specific remediation steps for each vulnerability discovered.

20. Risk assessment considers both vulnerability severity and business impact, helping organizations prioritize fixes for the most critical issues that pose the greatest threat to operations.
