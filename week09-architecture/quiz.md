## Answer Key (Instructor Use Only)

### Part A: True/False
1. **T** - STRIDE acronym is correct
2. **T** - Quantitative risk assessment uses numerical calculations
3. **T** - The five core functions are correct
4. **F** - Risk can be reduced but never completely eliminated
5. **F** - Security architecture should be designed before tool implementation

### Part B: Multiple Choice
6. **B** - Risk is reduced to zero (anything × 0 = 0)
7. **A** - Annual Loss Expectancy
8. **B** - Tampering (modifying data)
9. **B** - To standardize security control categories and requirements
10. **B** - Anything of value that needs protection
11. **B** - Inherent risk exists before controls, residual risk exists after controls
12. **C** - Technical vulnerability details (BIA focuses on business impact)
13. **B** - Using multiple layers of security controls
14. **B** - Implementation Group 2 (intermediate) for most organizations
15. **B** - To align security with business objectives and manage risk

### Part C: Short Answer (Sample Answers)
16. Threat modeling systematically identifies potential attack vectors and vulnerabilities during the design phase, allowing architects to build appropriate defenses before implementation rather than retrofitting security.

17. Qualitative assessment uses descriptive categories (high/medium/low) and expert judgment, while quantitative assessment uses numerical data and mathematical calculations to determine specific risk values in monetary terms.

18. Mapping controls to multiple frameworks ensures comprehensive coverage, supports various compliance requirements, and provides flexibility for organizations operating in different regulatory environments.

19. Security metrics and KPIs provide measurable data to assess program performance, demonstrate ROI, identify improvement areas, and communicate security posture to stakeholders and executives.

20. Business context ensures security architecture decisions align with organizational goals, risk tolerance, budget constraints, and operational requirements rather than implementing security for its own sake.
