## Answer Key (Instructor Use Only)

### Part A: True/False
1. **T** - SHA-256 always produces 256-bit (32-byte) output
2. **F** - HMAC verification requires the secret key
3. **T** - Only the private key holder can create valid signatures
4. **F** - MD5 is cryptographically broken and should not be used
5. **T** - Hash functions are designed to be one-way

### Part B: Multiple Choice
6. **B** - HMAC requires a secret key
7. **C** - Reversible with a key (hashes are always one-way)
8. **B** - Private key is used to sign
9. **B** - Small input changes produce drastically different outputs
10. **B** - Rainbow table attacks
11. **B** - 32 bytes (256 bits รท 8)
12. **C** - The shared secret key
13. **C** - Confidentiality (signatures don't encrypt)
14. **B** - To prevent key recovery through timing analysis
15. **C** - hmac.compare_digest()

### Part C: Short Answer (Sample Answers)
16. A hash function alone provides integrity checking but anyone can recompute the hash after modifying the file. HMAC provides both integrity and authentication because only someone with the secret key can generate a valid HMAC.

17. Digital signatures don't encrypt the message; they only create a signature proving authenticity and integrity. The original message remains in plaintext alongside the signature.

18. A hash collision occurs when two different inputs produce the same hash output. Collision resistance is critical because collisions could allow attackers to forge documents or bypass security checks.

19. Digital signatures provide non-repudiation because only the holder of the private key could have created the signature, making it impossible to deny having signed the document (assuming proper key management).

20. PBKDF2 adds computational cost through many iterations and uses salt, making brute-force attacks much slower and preventing rainbow table attacks, while simple hashing would be too fast for attackers to compute.
