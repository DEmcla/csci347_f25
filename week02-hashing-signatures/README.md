# Create feature branch for Week 2 assignment  
git checkout -b week02-hashing-assignment

# Navigate to your Week 2 assignment directory
cd assignments/CSCI347_f25_Jane_Smith/week02  # Use your actual name

# Verify git configuration
git config --get user.name    # Should show "Jane Smith - CSCI347_f25"
git config --get user.email   # Should show your university email
```

**Verify your setup**:
```bash
python -c "import hashlib; print('Hash algorithms:', hashlib.algorithms_available)"
```
