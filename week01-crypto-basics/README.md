## üéØ Weekly Assignment: Simple File Encryptor

**Due**: End of Week 1 (see Canvas for exact date)  
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours (simplified)

Build a command-line file encryption tool that:

1. **Encrypts and decrypts files** using password-derived keys
2. **Uses secure key derivation** (PBKDF2) from passwords
3. **Handles basic error cases** gracefully
4. **Provides clean CLI interface** for encrypt/decrypt operations

**Full requirements**: [assignment-simplified.md](assignment-simplified.md)

*Note: This is a simplified version focusing on core concepts rather than a full password manager.*

## ‚úÖ Self-Assessment

### Check Your Understanding
Answer these questions after completing the tutorial:

1. **Why is the same plaintext encrypted to different ciphertexts** each time with Fernet?
2. **What happens if you lose the encryption key** for your data?
3. **Why shouldn't you use ECB mode** for encrypting files?
4. **How does salt protect** against rainbow table attacks?

### Validation Script
Run the automated checker to verify your tutorial work:

```bash
python check-week1.py
```

**Expected output**: All tests should pass before submitting assignment.

## üìà Learning Path

### Recommended Schedule (7-8 hours total)

**For Well-Prepared Students:**
```
Day 1-2: Complete readings + start tutorial (3-4 hours)
Day 3-4: Finish tutorial + take quiz (2.5-3 hours)  
Day 5-6: Complete assignment (2-3 hours)
Day 7: Review and submit
```

**For Students Needing Extra Support:**
```
Day 1: Prerequisites review + setup (1-2 hours)
Day 2-3: Tutorial Module 1-2 only (3-4 hours) 
Day 4: Tutorial Module 3-4 + get help if stuck (3-4 hours)
Day 5: Start assignment with template (2-3 hours)

Day 7: Review, test, and submit

Total: 12-15 hours (it's okay to take longer while learning)
```

**üö® Time Management Rules:**
- **Don't spend more than 30 minutes stuck** without asking for help
- **Use office hours** - they're specifically for you
- **Focus on running code** before understanding theory
- **It's okay to submit working code** even if you don't understand every detail

*The tutorial includes comprehensive explanations and examples to support your learning whether you engage deeply with readings or use them as reference material.*
