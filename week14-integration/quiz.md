## Answer Key (Instructor Use Only)

### Part A: True/False
1. **F** - NIST has four phases: Preparation, Detection & Analysis, Containment/Eradication/Recovery, and Post-Incident Activity
2. **T** - SOAR platforms automate response actions through playbooks
3. **F** - Threat hunting is proactive and should be performed continuously
4. **F** - Human analysts are still essential; SOAR augments their capabilities
5. **T** - Effective dashboards show both technical and business metrics

### Part B: Multiple Choice
6. **B** - To proactively discover hidden threats
7. **C** - Eradication (follows Containment in the NIST model)
8. **D** - Network hardware management (not a core SOAR component)
9. **A** - Mean Time to Recovery (also Mean Time to Response)
10. **C** - MITRE ATT&CK (provides TTPs framework)
11. **B** - To provide consistent, repeatable response procedures
12. **B** - Mean Time to Detection (MTTD)
13. **B** - An assumption about potential threats to investigate
14. **C** - Follow established incident response procedures
15. **B** - High-level security posture and business impact

### Part C: Short Answer (Sample Answers)
16. Security orchestration automates routine tasks, standardizes response procedures, reduces response times, and allows analysts to focus on complex decision-making rather than manual coordination activities.

17. Reactive detection responds to alerts and known indicators after they occur, while proactive detection involves actively searching for threats and anomalies before they trigger traditional security controls.

18. Security metrics quantify program effectiveness, demonstrate risk reduction, show ROI on security investments, and translate technical activities into business language that stakeholders can understand and value.

19. Threat intelligence provides context for incident analysis, helps prioritize response activities, guides threat hunting hypotheses, and enables organizations to understand adversary tactics and likely future attacks.

20. Integration eliminates data silos, enables comprehensive visibility across the security stack, supports automated workflows, reduces manual effort, and provides correlated insights that individual tools cannot achieve independently.
